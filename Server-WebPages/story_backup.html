        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Our journey started with the idea of creating a web server on a virtual machine. Little did we know, it would involve many steps, technical challenges, and learning experiences. Here's the story of how we built this server from scratch:</p>
            <p>It all began with the installation of Oracle VirtualBox. We were keen to create a server that would host multiple websites locally, so we needed a VM to serve as our virtual machine on which we could install a minimal OS without the overhead of a graphical interface. After some research, we settled on Ubuntu Server—a lightweight, open-source OS designed specifically for such tasks.</p>
            <p>We created a new Ubuntu Server VM and proceeded to install it. This was the first milestone—setting up the virtual environment where our server would live. It was a clean slate: no GUI, just the terminal. We configured static IP addressing so our server would always be available on the same IP, which would be important for accessing the sites and managing them.</p>

        <h2>Challenges We Faced</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Throughout this journey of setting up the server, we faced several challenges, some big, some small, but all contributed to our learning experience. Here's a detailed list of all the problems and hurdles we encountered along the way:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Initial Network Setup on Virtual Machine</li>
                <li>Incorrect Network Access and IP Configuration</li>
                <li>Nginx Installation and Initial Setup</li>
                <li>File Permission Issues (403 Forbidden Errors)</li>
                <li>Configuration Errors in Nginx</li>

    <section id="technologies" class="section technologies">
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here are the key technologies and tools we used to set up and configure the server:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ubuntu Server (VM): A lightweight Linux server distribution used as the base operating system for the server.</li>
                <li>VirtualBox: A free and open-source virtualization software used to create and manage the Ubuntu Server virtual machine.</li>
                <li>Nginx: A high-performance web server used to host multiple websites. It was configured to serve different sites on the same machine using virtual hosts.</li>
                <li>Netplan (Networking): A tool used to configure networking on Ubuntu, specifically to set up a static IP for consistent access.</li>

    <section id="features" class="section features">
        <h2>Current Server Features</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As of now, the server has the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Web Server Setup (Nginx): Nginx is installed and configured to serve multiple websites from the server.</li>
                <li>Multiple Sites Hosting: The server is configured to host multiple websites by setting up different root directories under the Nginx configuration.</li>
                <li>Static Content Hosting: The server currently serves static content, such as HTML files, with basic styling (CSS) for a clean user experience.</li>
                <li>Local Network Accessibility: The server is accessible from other devices within the local network using its IP address.</li>

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Looking forward, the following tasks and improvements are planned for the server:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enable HTTPS: Set up SSL certificates to secure the websites and ensure HTTPS is used for all web traffic.</li>
                <li>Improve Website Management: Create a more streamlined system for managing multiple websites with different configurations.</li>
                <li>Implement Firewall and Security Hardening: Set up and configure a firewall to restrict unnecessary incoming traffic and only allow specific ports.</li>
                <li>Deploy Web Applications and Databases: Explore deploying a web application or a database service on the server to support dynamic websites.</li>
